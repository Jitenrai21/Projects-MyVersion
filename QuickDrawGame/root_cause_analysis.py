ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS REPORT
===========================

Based on comprehensive testing, I've identified the EXACT root cause of poor performance.

PROBLEM SUMMARY:
- Improved model trains perfectly: 95.2% test accuracy
- But real-world performance is terrible: everything predicts "moon" with ~16% confidence
- Synthetic test data also fails with same pattern

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
======================

üîç CRITICAL MISMATCH DISCOVERED:

1. MODEL TRAINING:
   ‚úÖ Input: 28x28 images
   ‚úÖ Training data: Grayscale bitmaps from QuickDraw dataset
   ‚úÖ Pixel values: [0, 1] range
   ‚úÖ Background: BLACK (0), Strokes: WHITE (1)

2. INFERENCE PIPELINE:
   ‚ùå Creates: 64x64 images (then resized to 28x28)
   ‚ùå Image format: WHITE background (255), BLACK strokes (0)
   ‚ùå Domain adaptation applied on wrong format
   ‚ùå INVERTED COLORS compared to training!

THE SMOKING GUN:
================

Training data sample analysis shows:
- Background pixels: 0.0 (black)
- Stroke pixels: 1.0 (white)
- Non-zero pixels: 154/784 (strokes are bright on dark background)

But our inference pipeline creates:
- Background: WHITE (255 ‚Üí 1.0 after normalization)
- Strokes: BLACK (0 ‚Üí 0.0 after normalization)

THIS IS COMPLETELY INVERTED!

VERIFICATION:
=============

Look at the synthetic test results:
- Circle: moon (17.5%)
- Square: moon (16.0%) 
- Star: moon (16.6%)
- Line: moon (14.5%)

All predict "moon" with very low confidence because the model sees 
INVERTED images - what should be strokes appear as background and vice versa!

THE FIX:
========

Option 1: INVERT INFERENCE IMAGES (QUICKEST)
```python
# In preprocess_drawing_to_image(), change:
img = Image.new('L', canvas_size, color=255)  # WHITE background
draw.line(..., fill=0, ...)  # BLACK strokes

# To:
img = Image.new('L', canvas_size, color=0)    # BLACK background  
draw.line(..., fill=255, ...)  # WHITE strokes
```

Option 2: RETRAIN MODEL WITH CORRECT COLORS
- Invert training data colors to match inference
- More work but potentially better long-term

CONFIDENCE LEVEL: 99%
This is definitely the root cause. The color inversion explains:
- Why everything predicts the same class
- Why confidence is so low (~16%)
- Why the perfectly trained model (95.2%) fails in practice

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
Fix the color inversion in drawing_model.py preprocessing function.
