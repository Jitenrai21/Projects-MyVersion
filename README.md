# Projects Workshop

## Overview

This repository serves as an experimental development workspace for some of my recent and ongoing projects. It contains rough implementations, prototypes, and exploratory work across multiple domains.

## Repository Structure

### Active Projects

- **Explore_Mars_CV_Game** - Mars exploration game with computer vision controls
- **InteractiveProjector-CameraGame** - Camera-based interactive projection system
- **QuickDrawGame** - Quick drawing recognition game with machine learning

## Development Philosophy

This workspace follows an iterative experimentation approach:

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quick implementations to test concepts
- **Messy-to-Clean Workflow**: Experimental code is refined here before production
- **Multi-Domain Exploration**: Computer vision, gaming, and ML projects coexist

## Repository Status

**Note**: This is a development workshop environment. Code here is experimental and may be incomplete. Polished, production-ready versions of these projects will be maintained in separate, dedicated repositories.

## Next Steps

Successful experiments and completed features will be migrated to clean, well-documented repositories for public release and collaboration.
